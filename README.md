# GaiaMind: The Planetary Intelligence Simulator

🌍 **Concept**

A C + Python hybrid system that models Earth’s ecosystems, energy flow, and human impact using AI-driven agents. It simulates a mini Earth where AI agents (humans, companies, nature systems) interact, learn, and adapt to maintain sustainability or face collapse. Think of it as a climate + economics + population + energy neural simulation engine.

🧠 **What It Does**
- Simulate a world where agents make decisions (consume, pollute, recycle, trade).
- AI predicts long-term outcomes (environmental, social, economic).
- Show if Earth is heading toward sustainability or collapse.
- Users can tweak parameters: temperature rise rate, energy sources ratio, population growth, AI policy efficiency.
- Predict the next 100 years of simulation.

⚙️ **Core Components**
1. **C Engine (Core Simulation Layer)**: Handles world physics, population, and resource math efficiently. Updates states like population, energy, pollution, etc., per simulation tick.
2. **Python AI Layer**: Uses ML models (e.g., Reinforcement Learning) for policy learning, connected via CSV or socket.
3. **Visualization (Streamlit Dashboard)**: Interactive graphs for CO₂ over time, GDP vs. Sustainability index, energy distribution, and ecosystem survival probability.
4. **Scientific Depth**: Physics-based models with real data (e.g., NASA, UN), multi-agent game theory for negotiations.

🚀 **Setup Instructions**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install C compiler (e.g., GCC).
   - Install Python 3.x with libraries: `pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow` (for ML).
   - Optional: Real-time data APIs (e.g., NOAA, Open-Meteo).
2. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd gaiamind
   ```
3. **Build C Engine**:
   ```bash
   cd core_c
   make  # Assuming Makefile is set up
   ```
4. **Run Simulation**:
   - Execute C binary to generate simulation data.
   - Run Python AI training: `python ai_python/train_model.py`.
   - Launch Dashboard: `streamlit run viz/app.py`.
5. **Usage**:
   - Tweak parameters in `data/initial_conditions.csv`.
   - View results in `results/world_log.csv`.
   - Interact with sliders in the Streamlit app for real-time tweaks.

🏆 **Advanced Expansion**
- Integrate APIs (UN Data, NOAA) for real-time Earth status.
- Add neural symbolic reasoning for AI explanations.
- Implement distributed computing for parallel simulations.
- Publish as research: "Agent-Based AI Simulation for Global Sustainability".
